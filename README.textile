h1. redmine_custom_fields_deps

This is a Redmine plugin that allows you to make two custom fields with list format and issue related to depend as category and subcategory.

h2. Motivation

One real company wants to use Redmine as ticketing system for helpdesk service.

The requirement is that there are two custom fiels identifying system and subsystem to report the incident. 

You need two selects, one that is "system" and another which content depends on the "system" selectd. This second select is  aka "subsystem".

h2. Sample YAML

<pre>
	Mainframe:
	 - Contracts
	 - Clients
	Java portal:
	 - Invoice
	 - AT
	 - Spool	
</pre>

h2. Issues

Does not work if custom fields are 'for all projects', since it depends  on finding the projects custom fields explicitly associated with the project.

h2. Project module

It now has acts as a project module to configure the default assignee for the ticket depending on the values of the dependent custom fields (see #3)
